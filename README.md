# Number Replacer

#### By Paige Williams, October 26th 2018

## Description

_This is an excercise in JavaScript arrays and looping. The application inputs a number from the user and once submitted, returns a list of numbers up to the number inputted. However, numbers that contain the digit 0 and 1 are replaced with the words "Beep" and "Boop." Additionally, numbers that are divisible by three are replaced with the phrase, "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that."_
